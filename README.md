# Deep Q Network (DQN)
A Tensorflow implementation of a **Deep Q Network (DQN)** for playing Atari games.

Trained on [OpenAI Gym Atari environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari).

Based on [Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf). This implementation includes the improvements to the [original DQN](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) detailed in the above paper, namely:
- Larger network
- Longer training
- Target network
- Huber loss

## Requirements
Note: Versions stated are the versions I used, however this will still likely work with other versions.

- Ubuntu 16.04 (Atari envs will only work 'out of the box' on Linux)
- python 3.5
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) 0.10.8 (See link for installation instructions + dependencies)
- [tensorflow-gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 1.5.0
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.15.2
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html) 1.1.0
- [opencv-python](http://opencv.org/) 3.4.0
- [inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki) 3.14

## Usage
The default environment is 'BreakoutDeterministic-v4'. To use a different environment simply pass the environment in via the `--env` argument when running the following files.
```
  $ python train.py
```
This will train the DQN on the specified environment and periodically save checkpoints to the `/ckpts` folder.

```
  $ ./run_every_new_ckpt.sh
```
This shell script should be run alongside the training script, allowing to periodically test the latest network as it trains. This script will monitor the `/ckpts` folder and run the `test.py` script on the latest checkpoint every time a new checkpoint is saved.

```
  $ python play.py
```
Once we have a trained network, we can visualise its performance in the game environment by running `play.py`. This will play the game on screen using the trained network.

## Results
Result of training the DQN on the 'BreakoutDeterministic-v4' environment:
